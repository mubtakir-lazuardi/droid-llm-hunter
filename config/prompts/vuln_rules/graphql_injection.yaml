prompt: |
  Analyze the following smali code snippet for potential GraphQL injection vulnerabilities.
  Specifically, look for GraphQL queries that are constructed by concatenating user input.
  This could allow an attacker to manipulate the query and access unauthorized data.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a potential GraphQL injection vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain how it could be exploited and suggest a remediation.
