prompt: |
  Analyze the following smali code snippet for insecure storage vulnerabilities.
  Specifically, look for the use of `SharedPreferences` with `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` and the creation of world-readable files.
  A vulnerability exists if sensitive data is stored in a way that allows other applications to access it.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a potential insecure storage vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain how it could be exploited and suggest a remediation.
