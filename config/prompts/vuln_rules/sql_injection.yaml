  Analyze the following Java code snippet for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
  Specifically, look for cases where user input is concatenated directly into SQL queries executed via `rawQuery`, `execSQL`, or similar methods.

  Code:
  ```java
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a SQL Injection vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain how to exploit it and provide a remediated code snippet using parameterized queries.
