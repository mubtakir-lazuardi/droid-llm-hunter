name: "WebView via DeepLink"
description: "Detects potential WebView vulnerabilities exposed via deep links."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following AndroidManifest.xml snippet for vulnerabilities related to deep links and WebViews.
  Specifically, look for <intent-filter> tags with an <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /> that open an activity containing a WebView.
  If you find such a deep link, check if the corresponding activity validates the URL loaded into the WebView.
  A vulnerability exists if the WebView loads a URL from an intent without proper validation, which could lead to XSS or other attacks.

  AndroidManifest.xml:
  ```xml
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a WebView via DeepLink vulnerability in this manifest? If yes, explain the risk and provide a recommendation.
