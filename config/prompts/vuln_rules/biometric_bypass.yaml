name: "Biometric Authentication Bypass"
description: "Detects potential weaknesses in the implementation of biometric authentication."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following smali code snippet for potential biometric authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
  Specifically, look for implementations of `BiometricPrompt` and check if the `onAuthenticationSucceeded` callback is properly secured.
  A vulnerability exists if the success callback can be easily triggered without actual biometric authentication, for example, by manipulating the application's control flow.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a potential biometric authentication bypass vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain how it could be exploited and suggest a remediation.
