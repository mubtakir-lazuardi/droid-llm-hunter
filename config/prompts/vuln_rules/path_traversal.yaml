description: "Detects path traversal vulnerabilities in ContentProviders."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following smali code snippet for path traversal vulnerabilities.
  Specifically, look for the use of `ContentProvider` and check if the `openFile` method is properly implemented to prevent path traversal attacks.
  A vulnerability exists if a malicious user can access files outside of the intended directory.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a potential path traversal vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain how it could be exploited and suggest a remediation.
