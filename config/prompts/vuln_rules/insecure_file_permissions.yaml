  Analyze the following smali code snippet for insecure file permissions.
  Specifically, look for `openFileOutput` calls where the mode is `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` or `MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE`.
  These modes are deprecated and can lead to security vulnerabilities.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there an insecure file permission vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain the risk and suggest a remediation.
