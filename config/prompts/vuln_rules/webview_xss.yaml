description: "Detects potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WebViews."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following Java code snippet for WebView XSS vulnerabilities.
  Look for WebViews where JavaScript is enabled (`setJavaScriptEnabled(true)`) and untrusted content is loaded via `loadUrl` or `loadData`.

  Code:
  ```java
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there a potential XSS vulnerability in this WebView implementation? If yes, explain the risk and recommend mitigation strategies like disabling JavaScript if not needed, or sanitizing input.
