name: "Insecure Random Number Generation"
description: "Detects the use of insecure random number generators."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following smali code snippet for the use of insecure random number generators.
  Specifically, look for the use of `Ljava/util/Random;`. This class is not cryptographically secure and should not be used for security-sensitive applications.
  Instead, `Ljava/security/SecureRandom;` should be used.

  Code:
  ```smali
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there an insecure random number generation vulnerability in this code? If yes, explain the risk and suggest a remediation.
