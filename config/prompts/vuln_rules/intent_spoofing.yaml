name: "Intent Spoofing"
description: "Detects exported components that are not properly protected and could be vulnerable to intent spoofing."
prompt: |
  Analyze the following AndroidManifest.xml snippet for vulnerabilities related to intent spoofing.
  Specifically, look for exported activities, services, or receivers that do not have a permission attribute or have a permission that is not strong enough.
  An attacker could send an intent to these components and perform unauthorized actions.

  AndroidManifest.xml:
  ```xml
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  Context:
  - File Path: {file_path}

  Is there an Intent Spoofing vulnerability in this manifest? If yes, explain the risk and provide a recommendation.
